# Identify Customer Segments with Arvato and Udacity
Applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany, [Arvato-Bertelsmann](https://www.bertelsmann.com/divisions/arvato/#st-1). These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data has been provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.

- **Data Understanding:** Explored and preprocessed demographics data with +800k observations and 85 features.
- **Data Preparation:** Assessed missing data, encoded features, applied feature scaling and performed dimensionality reduction . Interpreted principal components.
- **Data Modeling:** Selected appropiate number of clusters based on data. Applied clustering to general demographics.
- **Results Evaluation:** Applied all the above to customer base data and compare results to general population. Cluster analysis.
