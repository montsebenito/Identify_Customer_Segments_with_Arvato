# Identify_Customer_Segments_with_Arvato
Applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany, Arvato-Bertelsmann. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.
